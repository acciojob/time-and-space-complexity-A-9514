<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	
<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.It's an efficient measurement of time</p>
<p><b>The Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size.It includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.It is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space.</p>
